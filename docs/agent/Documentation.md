# Documentation Log

Status: `public-synthetic`

Purpose:

- record verification and cleanup checkpoints that are safe for a public repository
- avoid storing local-only case facts, local absolute paths, personal names, or generated counsel artifacts
- keep detailed private run logs in the local private workspace, not in tracked docs

## 2026-04-20 publication-safety cleanup

### Scope

- added a path-only privacy scanner in `scripts/privacy_scan.py`
- added a repo contract test requiring the tracked publication surface to stay synthetic
- quarantined local private/runtime/generated artifacts outside the repository
- converted public examples and fixtures toward reserved-domain, role-based synthetic data
- renamed synthetic full-pack attendance fixtures away from private system names and regenerated dependent goldens

## 2026-04-20 residual audit closure

### Scope

- treated the remaining caveats as fix targets instead of release notes:
  dirty-worktree wording, full-suite warning noise, Bandit suppression noise,
  and residual provider-specific public markers
- removed provider-specific legacy operator names from tracked `.gitignore`,
  changelog wording, and repo-contract expectations
- added targeted pytest warning filters for stale flat-flag and SWIG/importlib
  deprecations
- pinned Visualized-BGE auto-download to the HuggingFace file commit used for
  `Visualized_m3.pth`
- narrowed dynamic SQL and Markup suppressions to exact audited expression lines

## 2026-04-20 trust-boundary remediation

### Scope

- tightened MCP ingest validation so `olm_path` must be an allowlisted readable
  `.olm` file and runtime overrides must stay inside runtime roots
- removed the repository root from default output roots and rejected tracked
  repository files as export targets
- added shared no-overwrite validation for HTML/PDF, CSV, GraphML, report, and
  JSONL file writers
- changed default export destinations to `private/exports/...`
- extended `privacy_scan.py --include-history` from path-only checks to
  historical blob-content scanning without printing matched text
- updated the LOC contract to include untracked files in the dirty worktree

### Verification Plan

- `pytest -q tests/test_mcp_models_base.py tests/test_evidence_exporter.py tests/test_privacy_scan.py tests/test_repo_contracts.py::test_repo_maintained_files_stay_under_800_loc_threshold tests/test_cli_subcommands_evidence_report.py tests/test_report_generator.py::test_cli_generate_report_default tests/test_report_generator.py::test_cli_export_network_default tests/test_cli_integration.py::test_parse_args_generate_report_default tests/test_cli_integration.py::test_parse_args_export_network_default`

    - remediation requires a separate history-rewrite decision, not an
      in-place source patch
