## Section contract

Each section contains:

- `section_id`

Rules:

- the report-facing comparator matrix is derived from `comparative_treatment.comparator_summaries[*].comparator_matrix`
- rows remain evidence-bound comparison points rather than final unequal-treatment conclusions
- weak or non-comparable rows must remain visible as weak or not comparable instead of being silently dropped

When present, embedded `master_chronology` contains:

- `version`
- `entry_count`

- embedded `views` may expose:
  - `short_neutral_chronology`
  - `claimant_favorable_chronology`
  - `defense_favorable_chronology`
  - `balanced_timeline_assessment`
- embedded `retaliation_timeline_assessment` is the structured timing-review product for retaliation workflows and must keep confounders visible
- claimant-favorable and defense-favorable chronology views must keep visible uncertainty or counterargument content instead of reading as unqualified advocacy

## Evidence triage section contract

`sections.evidence_triage` is the counsel-facing split between what the current record directly shows, what it more cautiously supports by inference, what remains unresolved, and what proof is still missing.

It must contain:

- `section_id`

  - `missing_proof_count`
- `direct_evidence`
- `reasonable_inference`
- `unresolved_points`
- `missing_proof`

Rules:

- `direct_evidence` is for points that stay within observed-fact wording and remain anchored to direct cited material
- `reasonable_inference` is for bounded concern or interpretation statements that go beyond direct quotation but remain defensible from the cited record
- `unresolved_points` is for points that are not yet proven because ambiguity, weak support, low confidence, or live alternative explanations still matter
- `missing_proof` is for explicit evidence gaps that a reviewer would need to close before stronger conclusions
- every triage item must stay anchored to citation ids, finding ids, or message/document ids when such support exists
- `missing_proof` items may be source-gap markers without supporting findings, but must stay machine-readable and visible

- `supported_by_current_record` means the present record supports continued review of the issue track, not that liability or statutory satisfaction is established
- `alleged_but_not_yet_evidenced` means the track is explicitly in scope but the current record is still too thin or too incomplete for stronger support
- the section must stay neutral and preserve alternative explanations and missing-document needs for each track
- `issue_tag_summary` is the machine-readable tag summary that distinguishes directly supported tags from operator-supplied or inferred tags

## Lawyer issue matrix timing fields

`sections.lawyer_issue_matrix.lawyer_issue_matrix.rows[*]` may now also contain:

- `urgency_or_deadline_relevance`

Rules:

- packs must stay evidence-bound and tied to the shared actor/witness registry
- suggested questions should remain practical and non-leading rather than advocacy scripts
- record-holder packs may focus more on provenance, retention, and metadata than on motive or recollection

## Cross-output consistency section contract

`sections.cross_output_consistency` is the machine-detectable parity layer across the shared chronology, issue, memo, dashboard, skeptical-review, and drafting outputs.

It must contain:

- current checks cover chronology ids, issue ids, exhibit ids and ranking/strength carry-through, actor-role parity, skeptical-review carry-through, and drafting-ceiling alignment
- `review_required` means one or more parity mismatches exist and counsel or a human reviewer should inspect the affected outputs before relying on them together

Rules:

- the section must be derived from the shared actor-identity, chronology, communication-graph, mixed-source, and matter-workspace registries rather than a report-only reconstruction
- actor entries must keep role/status classification explicit instead of leaving people significance narrative-only
- coordination points must remain graph-backed and uncertainty-preserving rather than framed as final motive findings

## Promise and contradiction analysis section contract

`sections.promise_and_contradiction_analysis` is the mixed-source review layer for promise-versus-action rows, later-summary omissions, and contradiction review.

It must contain:

- `section_id`
- `title`

- `insufficiency_reason`
- `promise_contradiction_analysis`

Rules:

- the section must be derived from the shared mixed-source bundle and chronology registry rather than from report-only free text
- rows must keep `original_source_id` and later-source linkage explicit
- omission rows must remain lower-confidence than direct contradiction rows unless later source material clearly narrows the omission
- chronology-linked source-date contradictions may appear in the contradiction table alongside promise-versus-action contradictions

## Lawyer briefing memo section contract

It must contain:

- `section_id`
- `title`
- `status`
- `entries`
- `insufficiency_reason`

Rules:

- the memo must remain compact, non-repetitive, and evidence-bound
- it must not hide weaknesses, risks, urgent next steps, or open questions behind a strength-only summary
- it is an onboarding product for counsel and not a final legal holding or final legal advice
- the embedded payload may now include `bilingual_rendering`; when present, original-language quotations must remain separate from memo summary text

## Controlled factual drafting section contract

`sections.controlled_factual_drafting` is the disciplined drafting layer derived from the stable evidence, chronology, issue, weakness, and contradiction products.

It must contain:

- `section_id`
- `title`
- `status`
- `entries`
- `insufficiency_reason`
- `controlled_factual_drafting`

Rules:

- the section must surface a `framing_preflight` before or alongside the draft
- the allegation ceiling must remain explicit and must constrain the draft mechanically
- the draft must separate `established_facts`, `concerns`, `requests_for_clarification`, and `formal_demands`
- the draft must not convert concern-level support into motive attribution, liability claims, or unsupported legal conclusions
- the embedded payload may now include `bilingual_rendering`; if output text is English-facing, original-language evidence still remains anchored in the shared exhibit register

## Case dashboard section contract

`sections.case_dashboard` is the compact refreshable dashboard derived from shared matter entities and downstream stable registries.

It must contain:

- `section_id`
- `title`
- `status`
- `entries`
- `insufficiency_reason`
- `case_dashboard`

The embedded dashboard may now also expose:

- `summary.timing_warning_count`
- `cards.timing_warnings`

Rules:

- timing-warning cards are short operational prompts, not legal deadline conclusions
- the dashboard timing-warning card must be derived from the shared `deadline_warnings` payload rather than from independent wording logic

Rules:

- the dashboard must stay card-like rather than long-form
- its cards must be traceable to stable shared products such as the matter workspace, evidence index, chronology, issue matrix, actor map, and weakness/request layers
- it must refresh from entity and registry changes instead of depending on handwritten memo prose
- the embedded payload may now include `bilingual_rendering`; strongest-exhibit cards may carry `quoted_evidence` so original-language passages remain visible
- `top_15_exhibits`
- `top_10_missing_exhibits`

Rules:

- this section is the durable exhibit register surface for later dossier, chronology, and export work
- exhibit rows must stay anchored to source provenance, citation ids, finding ids, or stable source ids
- the report section may summarize only the first few rows, but the embedded `matter_evidence_index` payload remains the source of truth
- exhibit rows now carry structured `exhibit_reliability` data so counsel-facing review can distinguish `strength`, `reason`, and `next_step_logic.readiness` without re-deriving them from narrative prose
- the embedded payload now also carries the first dossier-priority layer through `top_15_exhibits` and concrete `top_10_missing_exhibits`

- `missing_proof`
- `urgency_or_deadline_relevance`
- `supporting_finding_ids`
- `supporting_citation_ids`
- `supporting_uids`
- `not_legal_advice`

Rules:

- this section maps facts to possible legal relevance for counsel review; it does not give final legal advice or assert statutory satisfaction
- rows must stay anchored to the neutral `employment_issue_frameworks` layer, the exhibit register, and existing finding or comparator support
- `likely_opposing_argument` must remain visible instead of collapsing the matrix into one-sided advocacy
- `strongest_documents` must point to actual exhibit-register rows, not inferred or hypothetical documents
- `not_legal_advice` must always be `true`
- if bilingual rendering is active, `strongest_documents[*].quoted_evidence.original_text` remains the original-language evidence anchor

## Skeptical employer-side review section contract

Rules:

- this section is a stress-test layer, not a defense merits holding
- each criticism must be paired with concrete repair guidance
- `cautious_rewrite` must reduce overstatement instead of merely warning about it
- the section may draw on chronology gaps, comparator weakness, alternative explanations, missing documents, internal inconsistency, and weak legal-to-evidence linkage

`sections.document_request_checklist` is the concrete records-request and preservation workflow derived from missing-proof analysis.

It must contain:

- `section_id`

- `status`
- `entries`
- `insufficiency_reason`

- `targeted_hostility_concern`
- `unequal_treatment_concern`
- `retaliation_concern`
- `discrimination_concern`
- `mobbing_like_pattern_concern`

- `assessment_strength` must always be present and use the current evidence-strength labels when supported
- `secondary_plausible_interpretations` may be empty, but must be present
- `downgrade_reasons` may be empty, but must be present
- if `status == insufficient_evidence`, `primary_assessment` must be `insufficient_evidence`
- the overall assessment section must still include visible entries when it is supported; metadata fields do not replace the narrative entries
- weak-only records must default to `insufficient_evidence` as the primary assessment, while keeping stronger bounded interpretations only as secondary plausible interpretations when appropriate
- when material support and material counterarguments coexist, the narrative entries must say that the record is mixed rather than presenting a one-sided classification summary

## Budget behavior

Under tight JSON budgets the report is compacted, not dropped.

Compact mode keeps:

- `version`
- `report_format`
- `section_order`
- `summary`
- `report_highlights`
- per-section:
  - `title`
  - `status`
  - `entry_count`
  - first representative entry
  - `insufficiency_reason`
  - for `evidence_triage` only:
    - `summary`
    - first representative item from:
      - `direct_evidence`
      - `reasonable_inference`
      - `unresolved_points`
      - `missing_proof`
  - for `matter_evidence_index` only:
    - embedded `matter_evidence_index`
  - for `chronological_pattern_analysis` only:
    - compact chronology summary retains `date_gap_count`
    - compact chronology summary retains `largest_gap_days`
    - compact chronology may omit the multi-view chronology payload when JSON budget pressure requires it
    - compact chronology retains `retaliation_timeline_assessment.overall_evidentiary_rating`
  - for `employment_issue_frameworks` only:
    - first representative `issue_tracks` items
  - for `lawyer_issue_matrix` only:
    - embedded `lawyer_issue_matrix`
  - for `skeptical_employer_review` only:
    - embedded `skeptical_employer_review`
  - for `document_request_checklist` only:
    - embedded `document_request_checklist`
  - for `overall_assessment` only:
    - `primary_assessment`
    - `secondary_plausible_interpretations`
    - `assessment_strength`
    - `downgrade_reasons`

## Interpretation boundary

BA16 is a renderer only.

It does not:

- change evidence strength
- change quote ambiguity policy
- add new behavioural findings
- introduce legal or motive conclusions

Those concerns remain with earlier evidence/scoring milestones and the later BA17 policy milestone.
